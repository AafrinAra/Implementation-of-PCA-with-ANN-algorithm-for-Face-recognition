Implementation of PCA with ANN Algorithm for Face Recognition


This project implements a Face Recognition System using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction (Eigenfaces) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (ANN) for classification. The goal is to recognize human faces from images efficiently by reducing dimensionality and training a neural network on the key facial features.
